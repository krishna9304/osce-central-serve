  4. Professionalism and Ethical Consideration demonstration:\n
    - Pay attention to the user's professionalism, maintenance of patient confidentiality, respect
      toward simulated patients, and awareness of ethical considerations in clinical practice and comment along with specific examples from the consultation 
      where the user can improve the most.\n
  5. Overall feedback and Improvement Areas:\n
    - Provide specific feedback on incidents or interactions during the simulation, highlighting
      well-handled aspects and areas needing improvement.
    - Focus on any missed opportunities in history taking, overlooked physical signs, or gaps in
      patient condition and management explanation.
